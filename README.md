# Environment-based-Music-Generation
Freshman Research Initiative (FRI) Spring 2017 Final Project

Branches:
- publish\_mood: all code handling image manipulation and thresholding should be edited in this branch and determined to be functional before merging with  master
- play\_music: all code handling playing music correctly should be edited in this branch and determined to be functional before merging with  master

Idea 1:
- node publishes the number designating how cold/warm the environment is on a scale of 1-5
- node subscribes to that number and plays music from one of five categories
- happiness is everything: happiness, tempo, etc.

Idea 2:
- get more complex
- saturation determines tempo (slow, med, fast)
- hue determine happiness/sadness of song (on a scale of 1-5)
- three speeds and five moods -> fifteen categories
